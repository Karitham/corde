# corde

corde is a discord webhook callback API wrapper.
It's nowhere near prod-ready, but it's honestly usable, and it's open to contributions.

Be aware that breaking changes will happen as of now, at least until v1.

## Why

Having used most go discord libs available, I wanted something very lightweight, that could just run on a lambda.
The common libs out there didn't really fit that purpose, and neither did they implement the webhook callback API available.

It's from that usecase that Corde is born.

## Usage

See [todo](_example/todo/) for an example usage.
